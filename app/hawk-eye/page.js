                            Clint Barton was born in Waverly, Iowa, and raised in a dysfunctional family. After losing his parents at a young age, he and his brother, Barney, ran away from an abusive foster home and joined a traveling circus, where Clint honed his skills as an acrobat and marksman. Under the mentorship of the circus&apos;s master archer, he became a master archer, developing exceptional accuracy and reflexes. <br />Clint&apos;s life took a darker turn when he was recruited into the criminal organization known as the &quot;Black Widow&quot; program, where he met Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow).

He eventually became an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D., where he used his skills for good and was recruited into the Avengers.
